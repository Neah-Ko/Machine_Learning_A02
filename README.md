# Machine_Learning_A01
Matlab code of second assignement of EECS-4404 Introduction to machine learning and Pattern recognition course @York University
## Goal
Goal was to implement stochastic gradient descent method in respect to the hinge loss, to minimize binary loss. Thanks to this method I also implemented a multiclass predictor "One versus all" for a second dataset.
